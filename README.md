## Introduction
During the COVID-19 pandemic, deaths attributed to this disease were not accurately recorded for various reasons. To provide a more precise estimate of the number of COVID-19 deaths, excess mortality—defined as the difference between recorded deaths and expected deaths based on historical data—was calculated. This project focused on calculating excess mortality in four Latin American countries: Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Colombia. The resulting numbers were normalized to enable a fair comparison of the results for each country.

## Tools
Google Spreadsheets.

## Data Sourcing
The client provided one table named as **covid_dataset** with 1252 rows and 6 columns:
- `country`: name of the country (Mexico, Peru, Chile, or Colombia).
- `starting date`: starting date of the week.
- `ending date`: final date of the week.
- `week`: number of week of the year.
- `total of reported deaths`: total deaths reported from any cause (not just COVID-19) in the established date range that corresponds to one week.
- `total of reported covid deaths`: total number of reported deaths caused by COVID-19 in the established date range that corresponds to one week.
